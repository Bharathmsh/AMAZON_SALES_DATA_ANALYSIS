# 📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can drive strategic decision-making. Using Python’s data analysis libraries, we explore sales performance across regions, countries, sales channels, and product categories, while also identifying profit drivers and seasonal trends.

The analysis answers key business questions, such as:
- Which regions generate the highest total sales revenue?
- What are the average unit price and unit cost per item type?
- Which country yields the highest total profit?
- How does the sales channel affect order priority distribution?
- What is the average order processing time per sales channel?
- Which item types have the highest and lowest total sales?
- Are there seasonal sales patterns?
- What’s the correlation between unit price and total profit?
